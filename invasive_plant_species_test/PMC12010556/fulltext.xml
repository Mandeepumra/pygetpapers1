Litter is not only a link between plants and soil but also an important carrier of nutrient transformation in above-ground and subsurface ecosystems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Exploring the factors affecting litter decomposition and their mechanisms is essential for understanding the ongoing responses of the stability and health of ecosystems to invasion in fragile coral island ecosystems.</p><p id="Par5">Plant invasions are known to disrupt native ecosystems. The influence of invasive plants on litter decomposition has always been widely concerned in invaded ecosystems. Plant invasion is generally accompanied by alterations in ecosystem processes, including reduced primary productivity, altered rates of litter decomposition and trophic relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Plant invasion alters the species composition of native vegetation, which results in the changes of community structure and understory micro-habitats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Changes in the above-ground and below-ground environment of native communities have direct effects on the decomposition rate and nutrient release of litter from dominant tree species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Litter from invasive plant species may contain more concentrations of nutrients to that of native plant species. This could have implications for decomposition rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], which accelerated nutrient cycling in the ecosystem. In some contexts, the mixed litter of invasive plants and native plants improved the overall litter quality and promoted litter decomposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], thus changing soil nutrient dynamics and plant-soil feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, the effects of plant invasion on nutrient cycling within plant communities via litter were multifaceted and typically modulated by an interplay of biotic and abiotic factors.</p><p id="Par6">As biological catalysts, extracellular enzymes secreted by microorganisms are the &#x0201c;gatekeepers&#x0201d; of the nutrient cycle, directly involved in the decomposition of litter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], which plays important roles in the cycling of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus. The quality of litter directly affects the nutrient requirements and metabolic activities of soil microorganisms, and then affects the production and activity of enzymes. The addition of high-quality litter significantly improves soil enzyme activity, especially those associated with the decomposition of carbon and nitrogen, such as &#x003b2;&#x02212; 1, 4-glucosidase (BG) and &#x003b2;&#x02212; 1, 4-N-acetylglucosidase (NAG), which play a key role in promoting the decomposition of organic matter and the release of nutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. By contrast, low-quality litter may not provide adequate nutrients, reducing enzyme activity and slowing litter decomposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Notably, enzymes, as a link between soil nutrients and litter, can be affected by multiple abiotic and biotic factors. During litter decomposition, soil extracellular enzyme activity changes with soil nutrients and litter substrates, affecting the release of litter carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus acquisition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Extracellular enzyme activity was affected by litter matrix and soil nutrient availability. For example, it was found that extracellular enzymes were significantly regulated by soil nutrients and litter substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In some cases, soil nutrient availability was even explored as the main factor affecting the activity of extracellular enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The previous studies demonstrated that litter quality affects soil ecoenzymatic stoichiometry, regardless of decomposition time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Despite the significant body of literature already available on this field, the relationship between litter quality, enzyme activity and soil nutrient availability in vulnerable forest ecosystems affected by exotic plant invasion isn&#x02019;t fully understood.</p><p id="Par7"><italic>Cassytha filiformis</italic> L. (Lauraceae) is a perennial, stem hemiparasitic vine native to China mainland and was found to erupt occasionally in a few areas, resulting in slower tree growth, fruit loss and death of young trees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. <italic>C. filiformis</italic> were recognized on the Paracel Islands (tropical coral islands) formally in 1970 s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Decades later, the hemiparasite has been found on almost all coral islands (field survey). The effects of <italic>C. filiformis</italic> invasions on above-ground vegetation and soil properties on tropical coral islands have been clarified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, the effects of <italic>C. filiformis</italic> invasion on litter nutrient release and soil nutrient transformation of native plant communities in tropical coral islands are still unclear.</p><p id="Par8"><italic>Cassytha filiformis</italic> invasion inputs high-quality litter, affects enzyme activity, and changes the nutrient release of litter. Thus, we conducted a 90-d in-situ decomposition experiment in a native forest invaded by <italic>C. filiformis</italic> on the Paracel Islands. We explored whether litter quality affects soil microbial metabolism during litter decomposition. We hypothesized that (1) <italic>C. filiformis</italic> invasion improves litter quality and accelerates litter element release; (2) enzyme activities are affected by soil C content, soil N content, and invasive degrees; and (3) the mass loss rate of litter is affected by soil enzyme activity and decomposition time directly, and by <italic>C. filiformis</italic> invasion and soil properties indirectly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study site</title><p id="Par9">This study was carried out on Yongxing Island (16&#x000b0;49&#x002b9;N- 16&#x000b0;50&#x002b9;N, 112&#x000b0;20&#x002b9;E 112&#x000b0;21&#x002b9;E), a coral island of the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea. The island is situated in the central tropics and experiences a characteristic tropical marine climate characterized by consistently high temperatures throughout the year. The annual mean temperature ranges from 26 to 27 &#x000b0;C. The island receives an annual total precipitation of 1500 mm, while the annual evaporation capacity is 2400 mm. About 353 plant species grow on the island, 187 of which are wild species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The island has mainly guano phosphatic coral-sand soils, and the remaining immature soils are predominantly composed of coral sands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The vegetation is characterized by the dominant native tree species <italic>Pisonia grandis</italic> and <italic>Guettarda speciosa</italic>, with a sparse shrub layer and a dense ground cover of herbs, such as <italic>Scaevola taccada</italic>, <italic>Stenotaphrum micranthum</italic> and so on. Yongxing, as the capital of Sansha City, is the island that has experienced the highest introduction of exotic plant species by humans, and it is also one of the islands seriously affected by the invasion of <italic>C. filiformis</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">Sampling from the same area before and after the invasion is the ideal way to determine the effect of plant invasions. This method, however, requires &#x0003e;&#x02009;5 years of monitoring, which is not practical and is often unaffordable, especially for fragile ecosystems on small islands far from the mainland. As an alternative, forest communities that presumably had similar original plant communities were sampled, and divided them into three invasive degrees (IDegree) according to the visual coverage of <italic>C. filiformis</italic>, i.e. none (0%), mild (25&#x02013;35%), and severe (over 50%) invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]; we assumed that the non-invaded community represented the pre-invasion condition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Experimental design and sampling</title><p id="Par11">The below-ground litter manipulation plots were established in July 2023. Before this experiment, a comprehensive investigation of plants and soils was carried out in June 2018 to ensure the comparability (such as similar topographies with mean slope &#x0003c;&#x02009;5) of the sampling plots. Five plots were conducted randomly in each invasive degree of <italic>C. filiformis</italic> (i.e. none, mild, and severe). The dynamic changes of litter decomposition of invasive and native species in plant communities were investigated by in situ litter decomposition experiment (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Litter from native plants and <italic>C. filiformis</italic> in the community was collected in the plots and dried in the laboratory. The litter of <italic>C. filiformis</italic> decomposes so qucikly that we can hardly collect the litter of <italic>C. filiformis</italic> on the ground. Thus, we chose the old, yellowing <italic>C. filiformis</italic> individuals to represent their litter. Three different litter combination treatments and a control treatments were set up in these plots of <italic>C. filiformis</italic> invasive degrees, every treatment had five 1&#x000a0;mm nylon mesh screens containing 10 g litter. In uninvaded plots, litter containing native dominant plants was mixed in equal mass. In mild invasion plots, the litter mass ratio of <italic>C. filiformis</italic> to native plants was 3:7. In severe invasion plots, the litter mass ratio of <italic>C. filiformis</italic> to native plants was 1:1. The control litterbags with no litter inputs were used used to monitor whether they got into litterbags and affected the decomposition process. During our experiment, we found nothing but tiny soil particles that fall off easily in the control litterbags. A total of 75 litterbags (including five empty litterbags per block) were randomly placed on the soil surface on November, 2020.

The mass of litter in severe invasive plots was significantly lower than that in uninvaded and mildly invasive plots after three months of litter decomposition. After nine months of litter decomposition, the litter mass in the mildly and severely invasive plots was significantly lower than that in uninvaded plots (Fig. S2). Moreover, the invasion of <italic>C. filiformis</italic> also accelerated the nutrient release of litter, especially N (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> &#x00026; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), which could be related to the invasive plant, <italic>C. filiformis,</italic> providing high-quality litter into the soil. Characterized by high N content, low C/N and L/N, high-quality litter usually decomposed faster than low-quality litter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Our results showed that the mixed litter samples did have higher N content, but low C/N and L/N than native species litter samples (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), which supported the previous perspectives. The invasion of <italic>C. filiformis</italic> improved the litter quality of native communities. The high decomposition rate of mixed litter was an important reason for the difference in mass loss between uninvaded and invaded plots.</p><p id="Par22">However, <italic>C. filiformis</italic> invasion could not make all elements decomposing quickly, such as litter carbon (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The early eluviation of litter decomposition made the soluble litter substrates decomposing rapidly, including carbon and other organic matter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The decomposition of LC within the first 3&#x000a0;months of decomposition mainly led to mass loss of litter. After that, the soluble litter substrates decreased, and other substrates had poor decomposability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Our results also showed that the LC content increased at the 3rd and 6&#x02009;th month of decomposition compared to that of undecomposed litter (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Some studies indicated that the C release of nitrogen-rich leaves was slow after long-time decomposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Surprisingly, soil C, N, and P content were significantly increasing in the wet season with the invasion of <italic>C. filiformis</italic>, but not in the dry season (Fig. S3). The invasion of <italic>C. filiformis</italic> resulted in host plants shedding a large number of leaves underground [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], inputting nutrients into the soil. However, the C/N was significantly higher in the <italic>C. filiformis</italic> invasive plots than that in uninvaded plots after six months of litter decomposition (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), suggesting that the increase of soil nutrients under the invasion of <italic>C. filiformis</italic> might be at the expense of above-ground biomass loss, and the mixed litter with <italic>C. filiformis</italic> released a lot of nutrients in a short period of time, rather than a stable long-term release.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Enzyme activities were affected by both soil properties and <italic>C. filiformis</italic> invasion</title><p id="Par23">The invasion of <italic>C. filiformis</italic> delayed the peaking time of enzymes associated with the transformation of litter carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus during litter decomposition, especially in severe invasive plots (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In severe invasive plots, mixed litter with <italic>C. filiformis</italic> affected the BG, NAG and ALP activities, which were all peaked at 9&#x02009;th month of litter decomposition. Besides, the severe invasion of <italic>C. filiformis</italic> destroyed the host plant canopy, causing a large number of leaves to fall off or even die, resulting in changes in light and temperature understory and biomass loss of aboveground plant communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Changes of habitat characteristics understory significantly affected soil microbial communities, thereby altering extracellular enzyme activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The activities of BG and NAG peaked at the 3rd and 6&#x02009;th month of litter decomposition in uninvaded plots, while those were the highest at the 9&#x02009;th month of litter decomposition in the severely invaded plots, suggesting the release of LC and LP was significantly delayed by severe <italic>C. filiformis</italic> invasion.</p><p id="Par24">Except decomposition time and <italic>C. filiformis</italic> invasive degrees, the activities of different enzymes were also affected by soil properties differently (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>&#x00026; 5). The soil pH was significantly positive with BG and NAG, and lower in uninvaded vegetation than in invaded vegetation. The previous studies showed that the soil pH decreased, reducing the BG activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Soil P supply regulated litter decomposition and soil organic C dynamics. Low soil P supply limited soil microbial activity, slowing litter decomposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. By contrast, high AP had negative effects on BG and NAG activity. Our previous studies had already illustrated that the soil P and AP were significantly higher in native vegetation than those affected by weeds or invasive plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Although there was no observed correlation between soil C and N contents and the enzyme activities involved in the transformation of LC and LN (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), the contents of LC and LN were significantly different under invasive degrees (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This phenomenon might be explained by a long-term study that the release rate of LN was mainly determined by the initial N content of litters and the residual amount of litters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. ALP activity was high and only affected by decomposition time, explaining that the LP was stable during litter decomposition. Besides, the soil&#x02019;s high phosphorus content in the coral island might also be one of the reasons for the high enzyme activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">Unlike the BG and NAG, the activities of PPO and POD had a positive correlation with AP but a negative correlation with pH (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The POD activity was identified as a key defensive mechanism in mitigating reactive oxygen species accumulation in plant tissues induced by environmental stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A previous study also indicated that the increment in the activities of POD and PPO enzymes was a defensive mechanism for microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The soil salinity of tropical coral islands might be the main source of stress. Our results showed that the activities of PPO and POD were higher in invaded plots that in uninvaded plots in all decomposition periods, demonstrating that the invasion of <italic>C. filiformis</italic> significantly changed the functions and structure of microorganisms. POD activity was significantly higher at the 9&#x02009;th month of litter decomposition in the invaded plots than that in the uninvaded plots, indicating that the mixing of <italic>C. filiformis</italic> litter prolonged the stress time. The <italic>C. filiformis</italic> litter might have allelopathic effects, which can significantly change the litter decay dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The POD activity was affected by most of the environmental factors except soil C and P (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>&#x00026; 5). Soil salinity increased significantly under the invasion of <italic>C. filiformis</italic> and promoted POD activity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> &#x00026; S2), indicating that the invasion of <italic>C. filiformis</italic> had a stress effect on the microbial community. We consider that our results may reflect that the high-quality litter of <italic>C. filiformis</italic> accelerated litter decomposition but also intensified environmental stress, which negatively affected the &#x0201c;plant-soil feedback&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>The invasion of <italic>C. filiformis</italic> regulated the decomposition of litter by affecting enzyme activity and litter quality</title><p id="Par26">The decomposition of litter was affected by litter quality, invasive degrees, and decomposition time directly (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

Generally<italic>,</italic> litter with high N content decomposed faster than native plant litter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The enzyme activities positively affected the residuals of nutrient concentration in the litter, meanwhile, they were also affected by the invasion of <italic>C. filiformis,</italic> soil properties and decomposition time. The enzymes were important substances secreted by microorganisms that directly participate in litter decomposition, and their activity was significantly influenced by microbial communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Our previous study demonstrated that the invasion of <italic>C. filiformis</italic> changed the characteristics of microorganisms, which was significantly different from the characteristics of microorganisms in the native community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. With the changes in microbial characteristics, enzyme activity also underwent significant changes at different degrees of <italic>C. filiformis</italic> invasion, which might have led to a slowdown in LC decomposition. Many invasive plants accelerated the decomposition rate of litter in invaded ecosystems, which increased the nitrogen content of plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].

The invasion of <italic>C. filiformis</italic> accelerated the release of N by improving litter quality and accelerated the lignin decomposition by increasing PPO activity but delayed the release of C by decreasing BG activity. The high soil available phosphorus content was negative to litter decomposition in the uninvaded forest community, and the invasion of <italic>C. filiformis</italic> alleviated these negative effects and promoted litter nutrient release. However, the promotion of litter nutrient release came at the expense of aboveground vegetation biomass loss, creating a"positive feedback"effect that facilitated the invasion of <italic>C. filiformis</italic>, exacerbating the impact of <italic>C. filiformis</italic> invasion on the native vegetation of tropical coral islands.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
