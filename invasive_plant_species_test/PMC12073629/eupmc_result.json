However, the cross-species generality of this mechanism and its role in invasive plant success remain to be fully elucidated. This study systematically examined PPF effects using three invasive/native congeneric plant pairs from distinct families (Phytolaccaceae, Asteraceae, and Amaranthaceae) in Jiangxi Province, China. Key findings include the following: (1) Wide conspecific negative feedback across families, with four of six species exhibiting 6.2-12.7% biomass reduction under their own litter treatments (<i>p</i> < 0.05). (2) Comparable feedback intensity between invasive and native species, as indicated by average pairwise indices (invasive I = -0.05 vs. native I = -0.04; <i>p</i> = 0.15). Notably, the invasive species <i>Phytolacca americana</i> uniquely showed a positive biomass response (+7.1%), though underlying mechanisms (phytochemical or microbial) were not investigated. (3) Lack of correlation between PPF strength and plant functional traits or phylogenetic distance, as indicated by Mantel tests (<i>p</i> > 0.8), in contrast to the trait/phylogeny associations commonly observed in soil feedback systems. This study provided the first evidence of PPF universality across multiple plant families-previously documented only within Asteraceae-and highlights the potential microbial-mediated advantages in plant invasions.
